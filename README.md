- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikemoegling - I have been developing LOB applications on multiple platforms for over 20 years.  Its time for me to expand my boundaries and get busy on GitHub.
- 👀 I’m interested in software development of course.  I believe in using software development to benefit lives, workplaces, programmers work days, and bring innovation to those who need fresh ideas and solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to break free of the regular business LOB programming and apply Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C# to come up with something new and fresh.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can help with.  
- 📫 How to reach me @mikemoegling on Twitter.
